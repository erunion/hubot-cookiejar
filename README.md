## hubot-cookiejar [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-cookiejar.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-cookiejar)

A [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) library for plugins to store countable items into a cookie jar.

For example, the [hubot-punjar](https://github.com/jonursenbach/hubot-punjar) plugin uses it to store the name of a user
every time they write a shitty pun in chat. Someone reports them, and they're "forced" to deposit $1 into the pun jar.
